# What is Big O? 

# The concept of asymptotic runtime, or Big O, is also called___?

# Give at least 4 different runtimes (just list):

# What are the different “CASE” scenarios as explained in the book? Explain each one. (hint: only 3)
-	 
-

# What is another factor we might care about in an algorithm? (hint: considered PARALLEL to Big O)

# Do recursive calls take up memory?

# Write the Big O for Space for this function: 
 
# Write the Big O for space for this function:
 
# Explain why this two function have the same Big O (in terms of time). What concept are we applying here?
  
# What does O(N2+N) evaluate to in Big O? What concept are we applying?

# Write the Big O functions representing each line:
 
# Can we reduce this Big O function O(B2+A)? Why or why not?

# In terms of a multi-part algorithm, how would we explain adding two runtimes vs multiplying (in english terms): 
 

# What is Amortized Time? When do you apply this concept? Try to give a specific example?

# What type of scenario would signal that a Big O is O(log N)?

# Describe the Big O of this function call stack:  O(branches depth) 

# Does the base of an Exponent matter for a O(2n) function?
