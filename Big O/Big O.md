# What is Big O? 

The concept of asymptotic runtime, or Big O, is also called___?

Give at least 4 different runtimes (just list):

What are the different “CASE” scenarios as explained in the book? Explain each one. (hint: only 3)
    -	 
    -	 
    -	 

What is another factor we might care about in an algorithm? (hint: considered PARALLEL to Big O)

Do recursive calls take up memory?

Write the Big O for Space for this function:

Explain why this two function have the same Big O (in terms of time). What concept are we applying here?

What does O(N2+N) evaluate to in Big O? What concept are we applying?

Write the Big O functions representing each line on this graph:

Can we reduce this Big O function O(B2+A)? Why or why not?

In terms of a multi-part algorithm, how would we explain adding two runtimes vs multiplying (in english terms):

What is Amortized Time? When do you apply this concept? Try to give a specific example?

What type of scenario would signal that a Big O is O(log N)?

Describe the Big O of this function call stack:  O(branches depth)

Does the base of an Exponent matter for a O(2n) function?
